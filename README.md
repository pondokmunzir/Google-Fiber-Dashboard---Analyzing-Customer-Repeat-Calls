# Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Google Fiber Dashboard - Analyzing Customer Repeat Calls

**Project Excerpt :** Developed a BI dashboard to analyze customer support repeat calls, identifying trends and improving first-contact issue resolution.

**Project Description:**

The Google Fiber Dashboard project aimed to provide insights into customer support trends and analyze the frequency of repeat calls after customers' initial inquiries. The project utilized data from three different markets served by Google Fiber, focusing on customer call interactions, reasons for contacting support, and interaction timestamps.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Data Integration:** The first step involved consolidating data from the three markets into a unified reporting table. This process ensured that all relevant information was available for analysis.

2. **Dashboard Development:** Using Tableau, a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard was created to visualize the data effectively. The dashboard included multiple interactive visualizations and filters to facilitate exploration.

3. **Analyzing Repeat Calls:** The dashboard provided insights into monthly and weekly call patterns, the percentage of first-contact calls by day of the week, the types of calls that generated the most repeat calls, and the performance of different markets.

4. **Actionable Insights:** The project aimed to assist the Google Fiber customer service team in improving their service quality by identifying areas where repeat calls were most common. Insights from the dashboard would help the team address customer issues more effectively during their initial contact.

**Project Outcomes:**

The Google Fiber Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for the customer service team to monitor customer support trends and make data-driven decisions. By analyzing the data, the team can focus on resolving customer issues more efficiently during their initial interactions, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Future Enhancements:**

As the project evolves, additional features and data sources can be integrated into the dashboard to provide more comprehensive insights. This may include real-time data updates, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis of customer interactions.
